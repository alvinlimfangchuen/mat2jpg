# mat2jpg

Many image datasets are stored in the .mat file format due to its ability to compress data and store it in a smaller file size than image formats like JPG and PNG. In an effort to assist other researchers who require image datasets in JPG or PNG formats for tasks such as image recognition, I have developed a tool called mat2jpg. This tool allows for easy extraction of image datasets from .mat files and conversion into the desired JPG or PNG format, thereby providing researchers with greater flexibility in their data usage.
